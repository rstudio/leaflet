\title{Add UI controls to switch layers on and off}
\usage{
addLayersControl(map, baseGroups = character(0),
  overlayGroups = character(0), position = c("topright", "bottomright",
  "bottomleft", "topleft"), options = layersControlOptions())

layersControlOptions(collapsed = TRUE, autoZIndex = TRUE, ...)

removeLayersControl(map)
}
\arguments{
\item{map}{the map to add the layers control to}

\item{baseGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a group.
The user will be able to choose one base group (only) at a time. This is
most commonly used for mostly-opaque tile layers.}

\item{overlayGroups}{character vector where each element is the name of a
group. The user can turn each overlay group on or off independently.}

\item{position}{position of control: 'topleft', 'topright', 'bottomleft', or
'bottomright'}

\item{options}{a list of additional options, intended to be provided by
a call to \code{layersControlOptions}}

\item{collapsed}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), the layers control will be
rendered as an icon that expands when hovered over. Set to \code{FALSE}
to have the layers control always appear in its expanded state.}

\item{autoZIndex}{if \code{TRUE}, the control will automatically maintain
the z-order of its various groups as overlays are switched on and off.}

\item{...}{other options for \code{layersControlOptions()}}
}
\description{
Uses Leaflet's built-in
\href{http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#control-layers}{layers control}
feature to allow users to choose one of several base layers, and to choose
any number of overlay layers to view.
