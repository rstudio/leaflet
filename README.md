[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) is an open-source JavaScript library for
interactive maps. This R package makes it easy to create Leaflet maps from R.

```r
library(leaflet)
m = leaflet() %>% addTiles()
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer

m = m %>% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 17)
m

m %>% addPopups(-93.65, 42.0285, 'Here is the <b>Department of Statistics</b>, ISU')
```

## Installation

You can install this package from CRAN, or the development version from GitHub:

```r
# CRAN version
install.packages('leaflet')

# Or Github version
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('rstudio/leaflet')
```

## Documentation

In addition to the usual R package documentation, we also have extensive docs and examples at:
http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet You may use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet/issues) to file bug reports or feature requests, and ask questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r+leaflet) or in the [Shiny mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shiny-discuss).

## Development

`leaflet`'s JavaScript build tools use Node.js, along with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to manage the JavaScript packages.

Install `yarn` using the [official instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

You can test that Node.js and yarn are installed properly by running the following commands:

```bash
node --version
yarn --version
```

To make additions or modifications to the JavaScript `htmlwidgets` binding layer,
you must have all Node.js dependencies installed. Now you can build/minify/lint/test using `yarn build`, or run in "watch" mode
by just running `yarn watch`. JS sources go into `javascript/src` and tests go into
`javascript/tests`.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# compile
yarn build

# watch
yarn watch
```
