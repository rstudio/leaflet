<p>The Leaflet package includes functions to show and hide map layers.
You can allow users to decide what layers to show and hide, or
programmatically control the visibility of layers using <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/shiny.html">server-side
code in Shiny</a>.</p>
<p>In both cases, the fundamental unit of showing/hiding is the
<strong>group</strong>.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="understanding-groups">Understanding Groups<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#understanding-groups"></a>
</h2>
<p>A group is a label given to a set of layers. You assign layers to
groups by using the <code>group</code> parameter when adding the layers
to the map.</p>

<p>Many layers can belong to same group. But each layer can only belong
to zero or one groups (you can’t assign a layer to two groups).</p>

Groups vs. Layer IDs
</h5>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Groups and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/shiny.html#understanding-layer-ids">Layer
IDs</a> may appear similar, in that both are used to assign a name to a
layer. However, they differ in that layer IDs are used to provide a
<em>unique identifier</em> to <em>individual</em> markers and shapes,
etc., while groups are used to give <em>shared labels</em> to
<em>many</em> items.</p>
<p>You generally provide one <code>group</code> value for the entire
<code><a href="../reference/map-layers.html">addMarkers()</a></code> call, and you can reuse that same
<code>group</code> value in future <code>add*()</code> calls to add to
that group’s membership (as in the example above).</p>
<p><code>layerId</code> arguments are <em>always</em> vectorized: when
calling e.g. <code><a href="../reference/map-layers.html">addMarkers()</a></code> you need to provide one layer ID
per marker, and they must all be unique. If you add a circle with a
layer ID of <code>"foo"</code> and later add a different shape with the
same layer ID, the original circle will be removed.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="interactive-layer-display">Interactive Layer Display<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interactive-layer-display"></a>
</h2>
<p>You can use Leaflet’s layers control feature to allow users to toggle
the visibility of groups.</p>

<p>You can use <code><a href="../reference/showGroup.html">showGroup()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/showGroup.html">hideGroup()</a></code> to
show and hide groups from code. This mostly makes sense in a <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/shiny.html">Shiny
context with <code>leafletProxy</code></a>, where perhaps you might
toggle group visibility based on input controls in a sidebar.</p>
<p>You can also use <code><a href="../reference/showGroup.html">showGroup()</a></code>/<code><a href="../reference/showGroup.html">hideGroup()</a></code> in
conjunction with <code><a href="../reference/addLayersControl.html">addLayersControl()</a></code> to set which groups are

<p>If markers are added to different groups, and when using marker
clustering as described in the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/markers.html">marker</a>
page, leaflet will generate different sets of clusters for different
groups. This allows showing/hiding of marker clusters belonging to a
group independently of other marker clusters in other groups.</p>
