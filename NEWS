leaflet 1.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When used with `leafletProxy`, `fitBounds` did not return its input object as
  output, so magrittr chains would break after `fitBounds` was called.

* Add addMeasure()/removeMeasure() functions to allow users to measure lines and
  areas. (Thanks, Kenton Russell!)

* Add `input${mapid}_center` Shiny event.

leaflet 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Initial release
