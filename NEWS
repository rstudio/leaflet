leaflet 1.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Fix a bug where the default `addTiles()` would not work with .html files
  served directly from the filesystem.

* Add `groupOptions` function. Currently the only option is letting you specify
  zoom levels at which a group should be visible.

* Fix bug with accessing columns in formulas when the data source is a Crosstalk
  SharedData object wrapping a spatial data frame or sf object.

* Fix strange wrapping behavior for legend, especially common for Chrome when
  browser zoom level is not 100%.

* Fix incorrect opacity on NA entry in legend. (PR #425)

leaflet 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add support for sf. sf, sfc, and sfg classes are supported with POINT,
  LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, POLYGON, and MULTIPOLYGON geometries (note
  that MULTIPOINT is not currently supported).

* Added support for Crosstalk (https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/).

* Added option to highlight polygons, polylines, circles, and rectangles on
  hover (use highlightOptions parameter).

* Fix behavior when data contains NA points, or zero rows. Previously this would
  cause an error.

* Added `popupOptions` parameter to all markers and shape layers.

  missing/new functionality from those plugins. (PR #293)

* Added Proj4Leaflet plugin (PR #294).

* Added EasyButton plugin (PR #295).

* Added Graticule plugin (PR #293).

* Color palette improvements. All color palette functions now support viridis
  palettes ("viridis", "magma", "inferno", and "plasma").

* Color palette functions now support reversing the order in which colors are
  used, via reverse=TRUE.

* `colorFactor` no longer interpolates qualitative RColorBrewer palettes,
  unless the number of factor levels being mapped exceeds the number of colors
  in the specified RColorBrewer palette. (Issue #300)

* Upgrade leaflet.js to 0.7.7.1 (PR #359)

* Added a way for the Map instance to be instantiated via a factory.

leaflet 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* When used with `leafletProxy`, `fitBounds` did not return its input object as
  output, so magrittr chains would break after `fitBounds` was called.

  areas, via the leaflet-measure plugin by @ljagis. (PR #171. Thanks, Kenton
  Russell!)

* Add support for labels on most layers, that show either statically or on
  hover. (PR #181. Thanks Bhaskar Karambelkar!)

  configurable magnifying glass that displays the area under the cursor at an
  increased zoom level. See `?addMagnifyingGlass`. (PR #184, still Bhaskar!)

* Add support for Leaflet-MiniMap plugin by @Norkart. Adds a mini map to the
  corner that can be used to see or change the bounds of the main map. See
  `?addMiniMap`. (PR #184, Bhaskar again!)
