BUG FIXES AND FEATURES

* Relative protocols are used where possible when adding tiles (#526). In RStudio 1.1.x on linux and windows, a known issue of 'https://' routes fail to load, but works within browsers (rstudio/rstudio#2661).

* Added more providers for `addProviderTiles()`: "OpenStreetMap.CH", "OpenInfraMap", "OpenInfraMap.Power", "OpenInfraMap.Telecom", "OpenInfraMap.Petroleum", "OpenInfraMap.Water", "OpenPtMap", "OpenRailwayMap", "OpenFireMap", "SafeCast". (4aea447)

* `L.multiPolyline` was absorbed into `L.polyline`, which accepts multiple an array of polyline information. http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html#polyline. (#515)

* Fix bug where icons where anchored to the top-center, not center-center (2a60751)

* Fix bug where markers would not appear in self contained knitr files (cc79bc3)

* leaflet-label plugin now L.tooltip in leaflet.js.  labelOptions() now translates old options clickable to interactive and noHide to permanent.

* Fix a bug where the default `addTiles()` would not work with .html files
  served directly from the filesystem.

* Add `groupOptions` function. Currently the only option is letting you specify
  zoom levels at which a group should be visible.

* Fix bug with accessing columns in formulas when the data source is a Crosstalk
  SharedData object wrapping a spatial data frame or sf object.

* Fix strange wrapping behavior for legend, especially common for Chrome when
  browser zoom level is not 100%.

* Fix incorrect opacity on NA entry in legend. (PR #425)

* Added support for drag events (#405)

* Ensure type safety of .indexOf(stamp) (#396)

* `validateCoords()` warns on invalid polygon data (#393)

* Added `method` argument to `addRasterImage()` to enable nearest neighbor interpolation when projecting categorical rasters (#462)

* Added an `'auto'` method for `addRasterImage()`. Projected factor results are coerced into factors. (9accc7e)

* Added `data` parameter to remaining `addXXX()` methods, including addLegend. (f273edd, #491, #485)

* Added `preferCanvas` argument to `leafletOptions()` (#521)


leaflet 1.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add support for sf. sf, sfc, and sfg classes are supported with POINT,
  LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, POLYGON, and MULTIPOLYGON geometries (note
  that MULTIPOINT is not currently supported).

* Added support for Crosstalk (https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/).

* Added option to highlight polygons, polylines, circles, and rectangles on
  hover (use highlightOptions parameter).

* Fix behavior when data contains NA points, or zero rows. Previously this would
  cause an error.

  used, via reverse=TRUE.

* `colorFactor` no longer interpolates qualitative RColorBrewer palettes,
  unless the number of factor levels being mapped exceeds the number of colors
  in the specified RColorBrewer palette. (Issue #300)

* Upgrade leaflet.js to 0.7.7.1 (PR #359)

* Added a way for the Map instance to be instantiated via a factory.

leaflet 1.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  output, so magrittr chains would break after `fitBounds` was called.

  areas, via the leaflet-measure plugin by @ljagis. (PR #171. Thanks, Kenton
  Russell!)

* Add support for labels on most layers, that show either statically or on
  hover. (PR #181. Thanks Bhaskar Karambelkar!)

  day and night regions on a map. See `?addTerminator`. (PR #184, thanks
  Bhaskar!)

  `?addSimpleGraticule`. (PR #184, thanks again Bhaskar!)

  configurable magnifying glass that displays the area under the cursor at an
  increased zoom level. See `?addMagnifyingGlass`. (PR #184, still Bhaskar!)

  corner that can be used to see or change the bounds of the main map. See
  `?addMiniMap`. (PR #184, Bhaskar again!)

* `addScaleBar` and related functions added, for showing Leaflet's built-in
  scale bar in one of the corners of the map. (PR #201. Thanks Kent Johnson!)
