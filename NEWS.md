# leaflet 2.2.1

* When `addProviderTiles()` is used with `{leaflet.providers}` version 2.0.0 or later, the `leaflet-providers` HTML dependency produced can be correctly cached by knitr. When used with older versions of `{leaflet.providers}`, the HTML dependency uses temp files that break knitr's caching mechanism (thanks @qdread, @jaredlander; #884).

# leaflet 2.2.0

### Features

- Added support for SpatRaster and SpatVector objects from the terra package. (#728)

- `leaflet()` now uses jQuery 3.6.0 provided via the `{jquerylib}`package. As a result of this change, the HTML dependencies for `leaflet()` are included in the `dependencies` item of the htmlwidget object it returns. (#817, #821)

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Use correct license in OpenStreetMap attribution. (#811)

- Use `xfun::base64_uri()` for base64 encoding instead of **markdown** and **base64enc**. (#823)

- Remove dependencies on rgdal and rgeos. (#837)

- Respect option scrollWheelZoom=FALSE. (#827)

- Fixed #866: Correctly call `terra::has.RGB()` in `addRasterImage()` for a `SpatRaster` object. (#869)

# leaflet 2.1.2

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Removed S3 warnings found on R devel (#848)

# leaflet 2.1.1

## Bug fixes and improvements

- The default marker icon for `addMarkers` no longer worked, due to the CDN we were relying on apparently being retired. Fixed by pointing to a new CDN. (#782)

- New behavior from tile.openstreetmap.org caused `addTiles` default tileset to break when viewed under non-https protocol on recent versions of Chrome. Fixed by always using the https protocol to connect to openstreetmap. (#786)

# leaflet 2.1.0

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Enable JS function literals (wrapped in `htmlwidgets::JS()`) to be included in arguments to methods invoked on `leafletProxy` objects. (JS function literals could already be included with methods invoked on `leaflet` objects, so this change just brings `leafletProxy` to parity.) (#420)

- Add missing CSS rule to show `<img>` in right-pane and left-pane (rstudio/rmarkdown/issues#1949, #770)

- Allow for _hidden_ but not suspended leaflet maps to queue calls (such as add raster images) until they are rendered. If a new leaflet map is created, all pending calls are removed. (#771)

# leaflet 2.0.4.1

## Features

- Updated proj4.js to 2.6.2

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Minor tweaks to example data and tests, required to stay on CRAN

- Fixes broken URL (#742) and updated examples to run from system files (#576) including updated .Rmd and .html docs.

# leaflet 2.0.3

## Breaking changes

- `data("providers")` and `data("providers.details")` no longer exist. Please use `leaflet::providers` and `leaflet::providers.details`. (#636)

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Integrated data from `leaflet.providers` package. See [leaflet.providers](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet.providers/) for details. (#636)
- Fixed [rstudio/crosstalk#58](https://github.com/rstudio/crosstalk/issues/58), which caused Leaflet maps that used Crosstalk shared data in Shiny apps, to be redrawn at incorrect times.
- invokeRemote() now resolves html dependencies before passing them to shiny::createWebDependency() (#620).
- Upgrade leaflet-provider to 1.4.0, enable more map variants such as CartoDB.Voyager (#567)
- `sf` objects with `names` attributes in the `st_geometry` now visualise correctly (#595)
- GeoJSON objects missing `properties` can now be displayed (#622)

# leaflet 2.0.2

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Require viridis >= 0.5.1 to avoid namespace issues with viridisLite (#557)
- Fixed broken mouse events after using leaflet-search from leaflet.extras within shiny applications (#563)
- Use leaflet namespace on `providers` in `addMiniMap` to make the function accessible in other packages. Fixes [r-tmap/tmap#231](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap/issues/231). (#568)
- Require scales >= 1.0.0 to avoid exact color matching issues (#578)

# leaflet 2.0.1

## Features

- Added method `addMapPane` to add custom pane layers to have fine tune control over layer ordering. New feature from within leaflet.js v1.x. (#549)
- Exposed htmlwidgets sizingPolicy in leaflet() (#548)

## Bug fixes and improvements

- Default marker icon locations will now use unpkg.com instead of the leaflet cdn when using https or file protocols. (#544)
- `.leaflet-map-pane` `z-index` switched to 'auto'. Allows for map panes to appear above the map if they appear later in the dom. (#537)
- Use correct Leaflet.js scale control remove method. (#547)
- Start from world view if using flyTo or flyToBounds. (#552)

# leaflet 2.0.0

- Added more providers for `addProviderTiles()`: "OpenStreetMap.CH", "OpenInfraMap", "OpenInfraMap.Power", "OpenInfraMap.Telecom", "OpenInfraMap.Petroleum", "OpenInfraMap.Water", "OpenPtMap", "OpenRailwayMap", "OpenFireMap", "SafeCast". (4aea447)

- `L.multiPolyline` was absorbed into `L.polyline`, which accepts multiple an array of polyline information. https://web.archive.org/web/20220702182250/https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html#polyline. (#515)

  served directly from the filesystem.

  zoom levels at which a group should be visible.

- Fix bug with accessing columns in formulas when the data source is a Crosstalk
  SharedData object wrapping a spatial data frame or sf object.

- Fix strange wrapping behavior for legend, especially common for Chrome when

  LINESTRING, MULTILINESTRING, POLYGON, and MULTIPOLYGON geometries (note
  that MULTIPOINT is not currently supported).

- Added support for Crosstalk (https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/).

- Added option to highlight polygons, polylines, circles, and rectangles on
  hover (use highlightOptions parameter).

- Fix behavior when data contains NA points, or zero rows. Previously this would

- Color palette functions now support reversing the order in which colors are
  used, via reverse=TRUE.

- `colorFactor` no longer interpolates qualitative RColorBrewer palettes,
  unless the number of factor levels being mapped exceeds the number of colors
  in the specified RColorBrewer palette. (Issue #300)

- Upgrade leaflet.js to 0.7.7.1 (PR #359)

- Added a way for the Map instance to be instantiated via a factory.

  output, so magrittr chains would break after `fitBounds` was called.

  areas, via the leaflet-measure plugin by @ljagis. (PR #171. Thanks, Kenton
  Russell!)
